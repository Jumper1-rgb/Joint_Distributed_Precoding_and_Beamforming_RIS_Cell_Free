## Abstract of Article

The amalgamation of cell-free networks and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a prospective technique for future sixth-generation wireless communication systems. In this paper, we focus on the precoding and beamforming design for a downlink RIS-aided cell-free network. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by jointly optimizing the combining vector, active precoding, and passive RIS beamforming for minimizing the weighted sum of users' mean square error. A novel joint distributed precoding and beamforming framework is proposed to decentralize the alternating optimization method for acquiring a suboptimal solution to the design problem. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed precoding and beamforming framework, showing its low-complexity and improved scalability compared with the centralized method.
